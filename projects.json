    "description": "Engineered a robust Medallion Architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold) to process large-scale semi-structured data for a Retail/Hospitality sector POC. Implemented Delta Lake to ensure ACID transactions and schema integrity across the pipeline. A key highlight was architecting a mission-critical infrastructure migration from legacy Blob storage protocols to ADLS Gen2 (ABFSS), resulting in optimized read/write throughput and enhanced hierarchical data management.",
